# Building-an-end-to-end-AWS-devsecops-CI-CD-pipeline-with-SAST-and-DAST-tools

## Project Overview
An AWS DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline with SAST and DAST tools automates secure software delivery. Code is committed to a repository, triggering the pipeline. SAST scans the code for vulnerabilities during build. The artifact is deployed, and DAST tools test the running application for security issues. 
Here's a basic structure for a README file for your DevSecOps End-to-End CI/CD project. This file provides an overview of the project, the tools used, and instructions for setting up and using the project.


## Tools & Technologies

- **Jenkins**: Continuous Integration server for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool to package applications and dependencies into lightweight containers.
- **SonarQube**: Continuous inspection tool for automatic code reviews to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**: A tool to identify vulnerable dependencies within a project.
- **Trivy**: A comprehensive security scanner for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other security issues within containers.
- **Git**: Version control system to manage code versions and collaborate with team members.
- **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**: Repository hosting service to store code and manage repositories.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Source Code Management**:
   - Code is stored in a Git repository.
   - The pipeline is triggered by a code push or pull request to the repository.

2. **Build Stage**:
   - Jenkins triggers a build process using Docker.
   - Docker containers are created for application and testing environments.

3. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - SonarQube performs static code analysis to identify code quality issues, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.

4. **Dependency Checking**:
   - OWASP Dependency-Check scans the projectâ€™s dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

5. **Container Scanning**:
   - Trivy scans Docker images to detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other security issues.

6. **Testing**:
   - Automated tests are run within the Docker containers to validate the application's functionality and stability.

7. **Deployment**:
   - If all stages pass, the application is deployed to the desired environment (e.g., staging, production).

8. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Continuous monitoring tools can be integrated to track application performance and security post-deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed and configured.
- Docker installed and running.
- SonarQube server set up and connected to Jenkins.
- Trivy installed for container scanning.
- OWASP Dependency-Check configured.
- Access to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Configure Jenkins**:
   - Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.
   - Connect Jenkins to the Git repository.
   - Add required environment variables and credentials in Jenkins.

3. **Configure Docker**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on the Jenkins server.
   - Update the `Dockerfile` and other configurations as needed.

4. **Set Up SonarQube**:
   - Install the SonarQube Jenkins plugin.
   - Configure SonarQube server details in Jenkins.
   - Define the SonarQube analysis task in the Jenkins pipeline script.

5. **Set Up OWASP Dependency-Check**:
   - Install OWASP Dependency-Check and configure it in Jenkins.
   - Add a step in the Jenkins pipeline to run Dependency-Check.

6. **Set Up Trivy**:
   - Install Trivy on the Jenkins server.
   - Add a Trivy scan step in the Jenkins pipeline.

7. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Commit and push code changes to trigger the pipeline.
   - Monitor the Jenkins dashboard for build, test, and deployment statuses.

## Pipeline Configuration Example

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        SONARQUBE_SERVER = '<your_sonarqube_server>'
        DOCKER_IMAGE = 'your_docker_image:latest'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git url: '<repository_url>', branch: 'main'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t ${DOCKER_IMAGE} .'
            }
        }

        stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def scannerHome = tool 'SonarQube Scanner'
                    withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube') {
                        sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Dependency Check') {
            steps {
                sh 'dependency-check --project <project_name> --scan . --format XML --out dependency-check-report.xml'
            }
        }

        stage('Container Scan') {
            steps {
                sh 'trivy image --format json --output trivy-report.json ${DOCKER_IMAGE}'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ${DOCKER_IMAGE}'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/*.xml, **/*.json'
        }
    }
}
```
